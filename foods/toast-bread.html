        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
            Ipsum.

        <h2>The Amazing Benefits of Eating Toasted Bread</h2>
        <p>
            Toasted bread has been consumed by people around the world, but wait, how
            many of us actually know why we toast our bread or what are the benefits
            of eating toasted bread? Maybe very few of us know! Anyways, the most
            important one is that when you toast bread, the nutritional value of bread
            gets changed.

           <h3><li>Helpful for Diabetics</li></h3>
           <p>Toasted bread can play an important role in life those who are suffering from diabetes. Toasting bread lowers the
                fat content in the bread and lowers the glycemic index. These two have a significant effect on someone with
                diabetes.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Lower Fat content</li></h3>
            <p>We all know that our bread contains fat which is one of the reasons for gaining weight. If you gain weight and
                you are suffering from diabetes, then it not good for your health. So, by toasting bread, you can lower the fat
                content of bread to some extent, if not completely. It’s not a significant decrease though, but enough to make a
                difference if you are having bread every day.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Choose nutritional bread for your toast</li></h3>
            <p>When you are buying your bread for toasting, then it’s good to go for the one with proper nutritional quotient,
                reasonable price and good in taste. You can try the whole-grain-bread that contains lots of nutritional
                benefits. You can also try some local breads as there is a very less chance that a local seller can augment the
                bread.

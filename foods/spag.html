        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h2>3 Benefits of eating Spaghetti</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is a versatile food that goes with a variety of different sauces and toppings. Prepare spaghetti
            simply by tossing it with garlic and olive oil, or create a more elaborate dish with tomato sauce,
            parmesan cheese and fresh garden vegetables. Add lean meat and serve spaghetti with a side salad for a
            complete meal,
            or serve it as a side dish at a family gathering. Use whole-grain spaghetti to get the most nutrients
            and fiber.
        </p>
        <h2>Energy</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is a type of pasta made from flour and water and formed into solid strings. Flour is a source of
            carbohydrates,
            the preferred fuel supply your metabolism uses for energy.
        </p>
        <h2>Nutrients</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is a dietary source of vitamins, minerals and fiber — especially if you purchase whole grain or
            whole-wheat pasta.
            One 1/2 cup serving of whole-wheat pasta has 90 calories but contains 2 grams of fiber as well as
            calcium and iron.
            Whole grains also contain higher levels of nutrients selenium, potassium and magnesium.
        </p>
        <h2>Fiber</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti — especially whole-grain spaghetti — is a source of fiber. Fiber plays several important roles in
            health including blood sugar regulation,
            digestion and immunity. Fiber slows the uptake of sugars, helping you keep balanced blood-sugar levels.
            Dietary fiber also absorbs water and adds bulk to your stools, promoting regularity.

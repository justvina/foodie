        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h2>4 BENEFITS OF STRAWBERRIES FOR YOUR SKIN</h2>
        <p>We all know that fresh strawberries are a tasty, juicy fruit. But did you know strawberries contain
            antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients that can provide benefits to your skin? As awareness spreads
            about the potential effects of potential downsides to certain cosmetics products, people are searching for
            natural ways to achieve some of their skincare and body care goals. And strawberries, as part of a
            well-balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables, could help play a role in meeting those goals. Here
            are seven possible benefits of strawberries for your skin and where you can find the best fresh strawberry
            suppliers near Toronto.
        </p>
        <h3>REDUCES UV DAMAGE TO SKIN</h3>
        <p>Strawberries are rich in a number of antioxidants, including ellagic acid and anthocyanin. Ellagic acid
            applied topically has been shown to reduce skin damage from the sun’s UV rays by inhibiting certain enzymes
            that contribute to the collagen breakdown, and by diminishing inflammatory responses. Collagen breakdown is
            associated with wrinkle formation and other aging qualities in the skin.</p>
        <h3>NATURALLY WHITENS TEETH</h3>
        <p>This may be the most surprising tip about strawberries – the small amount of malic acid in the strawberries
            can work to whiten your teeth. For a powerful, natural teeth-whitening treatment, try rubbing a sliced
            strawberry back and forth against your teeth. Let it sink in for a few minutes and then rinse your mouth.
            You’ll be surprised at how shiny and sparkling your teeth look afterwards! (Alright, tooth enamel is not
            exactly skin, but as it is an outer layer and this a too neat a benefit to pass up, we are going to count it
            as a type of skin – call it “tooth skin”).</p>
        <h3>TREATS PUFFY EYES</h3>
        <p>If you often wake up to dark circles and puffy eyes in the morning, strawberries may be able to help.
            Strawberries have astringent properties that can help provide a natural way to treat puffiness in the eye
            area
            and reduce inflammation.</p>
        <h3>SOFTENS AND SMOOTHS FEET</h3>
        <p>Spring and summer will be here before you know it, which means the sandals, heels, and flip-flops will be
            coming out of the closet. If you want soft feet, you can create a mixture with strawberries, glycerin, and
            ground oats and scrub away that dead skin cells.</p>
